# KMeans Clustering using SciKit Learn

Performed KMeans Clustering on Countries Longitude and Latitude data to get a basic understanding of how to utilize KMeans for segmentation of data based on similarities. 

Also used the Elbow-Method to find the correct number of clusters to be created as after a certain number of cluster there is not a significant decrease in sum of squares. Hence k=3 or k=4 seems to be the significant number of clusters for better representation of the data.
